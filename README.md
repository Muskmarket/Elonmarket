## 📍 How It Works (Game Flow)

### 1️⃣ User Registration
Users register by submitting a **Username** and a **Solana Wallet Address**.
- No email. No password. No wallet signature.
- Your identity is tied directly to your provided wallet and chosen username.

### 2️⃣ Token Eligibility ($EMARKET Requirement)
To participate, users must hold a minimum threshold of $EMARKET tokens (e.g., 20,000 $EMARKET). Our backend verifies your on-chain balance before allowing any predictions to be placed.

### 3️⃣ Prediction Window
Each round has a specific time window (e.g., 1:00 PM – 3:00 PM UTC). Users must cast their votes before the window opens or before the **Vote Lock** period begins.

### 4️⃣ Prediction Options
Each round features curated options based on the Musk ecosystem:
- **Grok / AI**
- **Tesla**
- **Starlink**
- **SpaceX**
- **X / X.com**
- **Doge**
- **Gork / Grokpedia**

### 5️⃣ Real-Time Monitoring & Validation
Our dedicated scraping engine monitors Elon's X profile in real-time. A valid winning post must:
- Be authored or reposted by Elon.
- Appear within the prediction window.
- Contain an exact keyword match (e.g., "Starlink" or "@Tesla").
- Be the **first** matching post detected in the window.

### 6️⃣ Automated Distribution
Once a winner is determined:
1. The system identifies all users who voted for the winning category.
2. The reward pool (10-20% of the current vault balance) is finalized.
3. **SOL is distributed automatically** to the winner(s) via the vault.
4. No claiming or gas fees required from the user.

## 💎 Reward Pool & Funding
The Elonmarket vault is funded entirely by **Creator Rewards** generated from pump.fun. An automated bot runs every 10 minutes to withdraw eligible rewards and transfer them to the vault, ensuring a continuous and transparent reward cycle.

**No-Winner Rounds:** If no matching post is detected within a window, or if no one voted for the winning option, the round ends with no payout.

## 📊 Data-Driven Design
Elonmarket is built on extensive analysis of Elon Musk's posting behavior. Over 75% of his activity consistently revolves around his core companies (Tesla, SpaceX, X, Grok). Our prediction windows and options are strategically aligned with peak activity periods to ensure high-engagement gameplay.
